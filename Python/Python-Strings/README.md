#### Debuting mode for f stings (python 3.8)
the expression you run and the representation of the value
```python
name = 'Adrian'
f'My name is {name=}'

# return
"My name is name='Adrian'"
```
*is more about meta language*

### Format integers and float 
```python
x = 123.3425

print(f'hello {x}')
# hello 213.32134

print(f'hello {x:.2f}')
# hello 213.32
```
